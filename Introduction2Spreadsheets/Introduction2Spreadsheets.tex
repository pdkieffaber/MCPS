The spreadsheet was originally a tool used by accountants to organize and display data in tabular form. Today, spreadsheet applications are computer programs that turn your computer screen into a highly intelligent piece of paper. The first spreadsheet programs were VisiCalc (``visible calculator''), Lotus 1-2-3, and Microsoft Excel. The power of computer spreadsheets is that they can automate repetitive calculations and permit the definition of dynamic formulae that are automatically updated when new data are added or revisions to the spreadsheet are made. Many scientists also use spreadsheets to store raw data, perform data analyses and generate graphs. The following chapter provides a general introduction to spreadsheets using the ``Sheets'' spreadsheet application of the Google software suite, a free alternative to programs like Microsoft Excel.
